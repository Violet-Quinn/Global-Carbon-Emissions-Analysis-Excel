# CO₂ Emissions Dashboard

A comprehensive **CO₂ Emissions Dashboard** that visualizes and analyzes the global CO₂ emissions data over time. The dataset includes emissions data from countries around the world, categorized by year, region, and emissions per capita, sourced from **kaggle.com**. The dashboard offers valuable insights into the trends, highest emitting countries, and per capita emissions.

## Features:
1. **CO₂ Emissions Over Time**:
   - A line chart showing the global **total CO₂ emissions** over the years, allowing users to observe the changes in emissions over time. 
   
2. **Top CO₂ Emitting Countries**:
   - A bar chart representing the **top 5 countries** contributing the most to global CO₂ emissions. 
   
3. **Highest Average CO₂ Emissions Per Capita**:
   - A ranking of countries with the **highest CO₂ emissions per capita**, showcasing the countries with the highest emissions relative to their populations.

## Analysis:

### 1. **Top CO₂ Emitting Countries (by Total CO₂ Emissions)**
   - **Conclusion**: The top 5 countries contributing the most to global CO₂ emissions are:
     - **China**: 18,07,22,82,929.26 Kilotons
     - **United States**: 15,83,17,88,080.68 Kilotons
     - **Russia**: 5,00,28,66,969.96 Kilotons
     - **India**: 3,98,82,72,999.97 Kilotons
     - **Japan**: 3,50,76,58,973.73 Kilotons
   - **Insight**: China and the United States are the largest contributors to global CO₂ emissions, with China leading by a significant margin. Russia, India, and Japan also contribute heavily to global emissions.

### 2. **Countries with the Highest CO₂ Emissions Per Capita**
   - **Conclusion**: The countries with the highest average CO₂ emissions per capita are:
     - **Qatar**: 38.54 Metric Tons
     - **UAE**: 25.11 Metric Tons
     - **Kuwait**: 23.59 Metric Tons
     - **Bahrain**: 22.07 Metric Tons
     - **Luxembourg**: 21.56 Metric Tons
   - **Insight**: Smaller, wealthy countries like Qatar, the UAE, and Kuwait have the highest CO₂ emissions per person. This is likely due to high energy consumption per capita, especially in regions with energy-intensive industries and lifestyles.

### 3. **CO₂ Emissions Over Time**
   - **Conclusion**: The data shows a **consistent increase in CO₂ emissions** from 1990 to 2019, with some fluctuations:
     - From 1990 to 2000, emissions grew steadily, rising from 2,03,41,800 Kilotons to 2,31,23,390 Kilotons.
     - The largest annual increase occurred around **2003–2004**, with emissions rising from 2,49,39,900.31 Kilotons in 2003 to 2,60,73,289.89 Kilotons in 2004.
     - Post-2007, emissions continued to rise steadily but at a slower pace, reaching **3,38,71,179.99 Kilotons in 2019**.
   - **Insight**: There has been a steady rise in global CO₂ emissions over the past three decades, with the most significant growth in the early 2000s. This increase could be attributed to rising industrialization, energy consumption, and transportation emissions. The slower growth in recent years may indicate emerging efforts or policies aimed at reducing emissions.

### Additional Insights:
- **Economic Growth and Emissions**: The steady increase in emissions correlates with economic growth, especially in countries like China and India, which have been industrializing rapidly. Their rising energy demands and industrial activities contribute significantly to the increase in emissions.
  
- **Need for Global Policy Action**: Despite some regional reductions, the overall increase in CO₂ emissions underscores the need for continued global efforts to combat climate change. High per capita emissions in countries like Qatar, the UAE, and the United States show that emissions are not solely dependent on the size of a country's population but also on their energy consumption patterns.

These conclusions reflect global CO₂ emissions trends and provide insights into how emissions have evolved over time, with particular focus on major emitting countries and regions.
